The bicycle is much more than just a means of transport; it is freedom, a lifestyle and a personal statement. 
This is also reflected in the behavior of Germans. Studies by the ADFC (2019, 2020) indicate that 78% of German citizens ride a bicycle occasionally or regularly. 
During the pandemic nearly 50% ride more often and for longer distances. 
In 2019, 5.4 million people traveled by bicycle. 
Interest has been increasing, especially since the start of the pandemic, with 1.8 million people taking a bicycle trip for the first time in 2020.
